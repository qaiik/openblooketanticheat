Rewrite of https://github.com/qaiik/blooket-anticheat, which kicked everyone from a public game, and didn't even work. \nThe only person was in 3rd place.\n\nvaluechests: crypto hack,\ngq: gold quest\nff: fishing frenzy,\ndd: deceptive dinos\n\nThe rest of the modes are either impossible to anticheat, or have too many varying value increments.
